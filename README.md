# BigSur
BigSur is a package for principled, robust scRNAseq normalization. Currently we can perform feature selection and correlations.

# What is BigSur?
Basic Informatics and Gene Statistics from Unnormalized Reads (BigSur) is a principled pipeline allowing for feature selection, correlation and clustering in scRNAseq.
* The correlation derivations are detailed in [Silkwood et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.14.532643).
* The feature selection derivations are detailed in Dollinger and Silkwood et al. 2023 (on bioRxiv soon!).

# Installation
The only way to install BigSur currently is to clone the GitHub repo.

# Usage
Usage for feature selection is detailed in the [example notebook](https://github.com/landerlabcode/BigSur/blob/main/feature_selection_example_usage.ipynb).
